 - [ ] Add and commit a few other files (anything you want) to the repository. 
 - [ ] Create a tag named v0.0.1.
 - [ ] Push all changes and tags to your remote repository (note that tags require a special flag to be included in the push).
 - [ ] Create and checkout a new branch named testing-new-files.
 - [ ] Add and commit a few more files to this branch.
 - [ ] Checkout the master branch.
 - [ ] Edit at least one of the files in this branch and commit the change.
 - [ ] Merge the testing-new-files branch into the master branch.
 - [ ] Checkout the testing-new-files branch.
 - [ ] Push all of your changes in both branches to your remote repository (make sure that both branches show up on your remotes host).
 - [ ] Find a partner to work with.
Grant this person/these people write access to your remote repository.
Clone your partner’s remote repository to a new directory outside your original repository.
Edit the README file in your partner’s master branch to list your name as 'Partner: (Your name here)'.
Commit your changes.
Push your changes to your partner’s remote repository.
Return to your original repository (but do not pull from your remote branch yet).
Checkout your master branch.
Edit your README file to add a line that says "This might cause a merge conflict".
Commit your changes.
Make sure that your partner has completed step 20 (pushed their changes to your README).
Attempt to pull your partner's changes to your repository.
Resolve the merge conflict if one occurs.
Commit the merge (assuming a conflict occurred).
Copy and paste the entry showing your merge resolution from the log into a text file.
Push the merged changes back into your remote repo.
